Project Overview
This repository contains the code and accompanying study materials for research on Teamwork Dynamics and Freeriding. The primary focus is on how personality traits—particularly extraversion and introversion—impact teamwork, how freeriding occurs in group settings, and how peer assessment can address imbalances and improve accountability.

Study Summary
Freeriding: Occurs when individuals benefit from group work without contributing adequately. This study identifies factors like collective evaluation, poor communication, unclear responsibilities, and group dynamics as key contributors (Ye, 2021).
Extraversion and Introversion: While extraverts excel at social engagement, they may unintentionally overshadow quieter members. Introverts often contribute valuable insights but risk being overlooked. Balanced teams harness both strengths (Khan, 2018).
Peer Assessment: Evaluating teammates on criteria like commitment, communication, and focus effectively reduces freeriding by recognizing individual efforts and enhancing accountability (Ye, 2021).
